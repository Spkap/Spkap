# Sourabh Kapure  

## Developer | Builder | Lifelong Learner

Hello! I‚Äôm Sourabh Kapure, a developer passionate about exploring the intersection of **Web2**, **Deep Learning**, and **Web3**. I enjoy learning and applying new technologies to build scalable, efficient, and innovative solutions. My current focus is on full-stack development, data science, and decentralized applications.  

### ETHIndia 2024 Winner  
**1st Best zk Dapp on Polygon zkEVM Track**  
Our project, **[zKonnect](https://github.com/swrjsingh/ETH24Submission)**, won the **1st Place for Best zk Dapp** award on the **Polygon zkEVM Track** at **ETHIndia 2024**.  

We built **zKonnect**, a privacy-preserving ticketing platform powered by zkSNARKs to address unauthorized ticket resales. The system binds tickets to the buyer's identity, preventing resale while safeguarding personal data. Designed for high-demand events, it ensures secure and transparent ticketing with robust enforcement against black market activity.  

### Core Skill Set  
- **Frontend Development:** Building responsive and interactive web applications using **React**, along with proficiency in **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.  
- **Deep Learning & Data Science:** Experienced in using **PyTorch** for developing **Neural Networks (NNs)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and **Computer Vision (CV)** applications.  
- **Security & Scaling:** Focused on **smart contract security** and **Layer 2 scaling solutions** to create reliable and efficient systems.  
- **Full-Stack dApp Development:** Developing responsive and high-performance **Web3** applications.  

## Current Learning Journey  
Currently exploring:  
- **Next.js** for modern React-based web development.  
- **Django** & **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for backend APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL** & **MySQL** for relational database management.  
- **Docker SDK for Python** for managing Docker containers with Python.  
- **NLP** for creating intelligent text-based tools and applications.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for building privacy-focused solutions.  

## Experience with UniDAO  
I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of Web3 through UniDAO 2.0 at NITK Surathkal. This program selected five colleges across India and was a selective initiative by Devfolio and ETHIndia. Being among 39 builders chosen from 270 applicants, I gained practical knowledge of decentralized technologies, including foundational principles, DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling, through an intensive six-week bootcamp.  

## Collaboration Interests  
I‚Äôm interested in collaborating on:  
- Full-stack web applications (Web2)  
- Deep learning and **NLP**-based projects  
- Blockchain solutions and dApps (Web3), especially those integrating AI/ML  
- Scalable data infrastructure and databases
