## Web3 Builder | Blockchain Enthusiast

Hello! I‚Äôm Sourabh Kapure, a dedicated Web3 builder with a passion for developing decentralized applications (dApps) and exploring blockchain technology. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a strong drive to contribute to the future of digital ecosystems. I'm currently diving into DeFi, smart contract security, and the potential of zero-knowledge proofs to enhance privacy and scalability in Web3.

### Core Skill Set

- **Blockchain Development:** Experience with DeFi protocols, smart contracts, Layer 2 solutions, and IPFS & Filecoin infrastructure.
- **Full-Stack dApp Development:** Skilled in designing responsive, high-performance Web3 applications.
- **Security & Scaling:** Emphasis on smart contract security and Layer 2 scaling solutions to ensure reliable and efficient systems.

## Current Learning Journey
Currently diving deeper into:
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving solutions
* Advanced DeFi protocol development
* Ethereum Layer 2 scaling technologies
* Decentralized storage with IPFS and Filecoin
* Exploring the Internet Computer and its applications

## Experience with UniDAO
I've had the privilege of immersing myself in Web3 through UniDAO 2.0 at NITK Surathkal. This program selected only five colleges across India and was a selective initiative by Devfolio and ETHIndia. Being chosen among 39 builders from a pool of 270 applicants has shaped my understanding of decentralized technologies in ways I never imagined. The intensive 6-week bootcamp opened my eyes to the vast potential of blockchain, covering everything from foundational principles to cutting-edge developments in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling.

## Collaboration Interests
I‚Äôm eager to collaborate on projects involving:
* DeFi protocols & DAOs
* Innovative Web3 infrastructure solutions
* Blockchain applications powered by AI/ML integrations
* ZK-powered applications for enhanced privacy
* IPFS-based decentralized storage solutions
