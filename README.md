# üöÄ Projects

### AgriVerify - Blockchain-Powered Supply Chain Verification

**AgriVerify** is a decentralized application (dApp) revolutionizing trust and transparency in organic farming through blockchain technology. Built on Ethereum, this project empowers farmers with tamper-proof certifications and provides consumers with blockchain-verified authenticity checks.

**Technical Stack & Features:**

- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Solidity (v0.8.20) for secure on-chain verification
  - OpenZeppelin contracts for battle-tested security
  - Hardhat for robust testing and deployment

- **Web3 Integration**:
  - ethers.js for seamless blockchain interaction
  - MetaMask for secure wallet connectivity
  - IPFS for decentralized data storage

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js for responsive dApp interface
  - Web3 Modal for wallet integration
  - node-qrcode for blockchain-verified certificates

This project showcases my ability to build production-ready dApps that solve real-world problems through blockchain technology.

### Automated License Plate Recognition System

A **standout project** is my **Automated License Plate Recognition system**, which I developed using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques:

- **Custom CNN model**
- **Transfer learning** with Inception-ResNet-V2 for plate detection and recognition
- **OCR** for text extraction

This project demonstrates my capability in applying AI to real-world applications.
